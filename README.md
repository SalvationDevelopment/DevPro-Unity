DevPro-Unity
============

A Unity Based YGOPro Client
The client is based on Unity3d. This project brings YGOPro to the web by using unity as a interface client for the YGOPro & DevPro networks. Unity translates the protocols of both to JavaScript function calls and interacts with the DOM creating an interface.
